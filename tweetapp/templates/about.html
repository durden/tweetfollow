    <p>
        Tweetfollow is a simple web app built to do one thing, let you know when
        you lose twitter followers.  You can just give us your twitter name and
        the e-mail associated with the account, and we'll send you e-mails once
        a day with lists of the users that have unfollowed you.
    </p>
    <p>Don't worry we don't keep your e-mail or sell it.</p>
