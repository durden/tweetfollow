About
========

Simple appengine project to allow twitter users to get automatic e-mail updates when
they lose followers.

The app only requires that users enter their twitter username and an e-mail to
receive updates.

Lots of features hopefully to be added and it is not stable yet.

Requirements
--------

Google app engine account.
